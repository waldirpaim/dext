**Dext** is a complete ecosystem for modern Delphi development. It brings the productivity and architectural patterns of frameworks like **ASP.NET Core** and **Spring Boot** to the native performance of Object Pascal.

The goal is not merely to build APIs, but to provide a solid foundation (DI, Configuration, Logging, ORM) enabling you to build robust and testable enterprise applications.

## 🎯 Philosophy and Goals

* **Inspired by .NET Patterns**: The goal is to bring the robust architectural patterns of the .NET ecosystem (ASP.NET Core, EF Core) to Delphi, achieving high compatibility with its design principles.
* **Native Performance**: After functional stabilization of v1, the focus will shift entirely to **performance optimization**, aiming to compete with high-speed frameworks.
* **Innovation**: While inspired by .NET, Dext is not limited to it, seeking to implement solutions that specifically make sense for the Delphi language.

## 📄 License

This project is licensed under the **Apache License 2.0** (the same used by .NET Core). This allows free use in commercial and open-source projects, with the security of a permissive and modern license.

## 🧠 Design & Philosophy

Dext's development is guided by two engineering principles that define every architectural decision made in the project:

> **"Simplicity is Complicated."** — *Rob Pike*

Hiding the complexity of HTTP servers, memory management, and concurrency requires sophisticated internal engineering. We embrace this internal complexity to ensure that your public API is **clean, intuitive, and noise-free**.

* **In practice:** You write `App.MapGet`, and the framework quietly resolves routing, JSON serialization, and error handling.

> **"Make what is right easy and what is wrong difficult."** — *Steve "Ardalis" Smith*

A good framework should guide the developer into the "Pit of Success". Dext was designed so that best practices—such as Dependency Injection, interface segregation, and using DTOs—are the natural default, not a burdensome extra configuration.

## 💻 Requirements

* **Delphi**: Recommended Delphi 10.4 Sydney or higher (due to extensive use of modern language features).
* **Indy**: Uses Indy components (already included in Delphi) for the HTTP transport layer (subject to future replacement/optimization).

## 📦 Installation and Configuration

> 📖 **Detailed Guide**: For a complete step-by-step walkthrough and advanced configuration, please read the [Installation Guide](Docs/Book/01-getting-started/installation.md).

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dext-framework/dext.git
   ```

   > 📦 **Package Note**: The project is organized into modular packages located in the `Sources` directory (e.g., `Dext.Core.dpk`, `Dext.Web.Core.dpk`, `Dext.Data.dpk`). You can open `Sources/DextFramework.groupproj` to load all packages at once.

2. **Configure Environment Variable (Optional but Recommended):**
   To simplify configuration and easily switch between versions, create a User Environment Variable named `DEXT` pointing to the `Sources` directory.

   * Go to: **Tools** > **Options** > **IDE** > **Environment Variables**
   * Under **User System Overrides**, click **New...**
   * **Variable Name**: `DEXT`
   * **Variable Value**: `C:\path\to\dext\Sources` (e.g., `C:\dev\Dext\Sources`)

   ![DEXT Environment Variable](Docs/Images/ide-env-var.png)

3. **Configure Paths in Delphi:**

   * **Library Path** (for compilation):
       * `$(DEXT)\..\Output\$(ProductVersion)_$(Platform)_$(Config)`

   * **Browsing Path** (for code navigation):
       * `$(DEXT)`
       * `$(DEXT)\Core`
       * `$(DEXT)\Data`
       * `$(DEXT)\Hosting`
       * `$(DEXT)\Web`
       * *(See [Installation Guide](Docs/Book/01-getting-started/installation.md) for the complete list)*

   > 📝 **Note**: Compiled files (`.dcu`, binaries) will be generated in the `.\Output` directory.

4. **Dependencies:**
   * The framework uses `FastMM5` (recommended for memory debugging).
   * Native database drivers (FireDAC, etc.) are supported.

## ⚡ Quick Example (Minimal API)

```pascal
program MyAPI;

uses
  Dext.Web;

begin
  // The global function WebApplication returns IWebApplication (ARC safe)
  var App := WebApplication;
  var Builder := App.Builder;

  // Simple Route
  Builder.MapGet<IResult>('/hello', 
    function: IResult
    begin
      Result := Results.Ok('{"message": "Hello Dext!"}');
    end);

  // Route with parameter and binding
  Builder.MapGet<Integer, IResult>('/users/{id}',
    function(Id: Integer): IResult
    begin
      Result := Results.Json(Format('{"userId": %d}', [Id]));
    end);

  App.Run(8080);
end.
```

## 🧩 Model Binding & Dependency Injection

Dext automatically resolves dependencies and deserializes JSON bodies into Records/Classes:

```pascal
// 1. Register Services
App.Services.AddSingleton<IEmailService, TEmailService>;

// 2. Define Endpoint with Dependencies
// - 'Dto': Automatically bound from JSON Body (Smart Binding)
// - 'EmailService': Automatically injected from DI Container
App.Builder.MapPost<TUserDto, IEmailService, IResult>('/register',
  function(Dto: TUserDto; EmailService: IEmailService): IResult
  begin
    EmailService.SendWelcome(Dto.Email);
    Result := Results.Created('/login', 'User registered');
  end);
```

## 💎 ORM Example (Fluent Query)

Dext ORM allows expressive and strongly typed queries, eliminating magical SQL strings:

```pascal
// Complex Query with Joins and Filters
// O: TOrder (Alias/Proxy)
var Orders := DbContext.Orders
  .Where((O.Status = TOrderStatus.Paid) and (O.Total > 1000))
  .Include('Customer') // Eager Loading
  .Include('Items')
  .OrderBy(O.Date.Desc)
  .Take(50)
  .ToList;

// High-Performance Bulk Update
DbContext.Products
  .Where(P.Category = 'Outdated') // P: TProduct
  .Update                         // Starts bulk update
  .Execute;
```

## ⚡ Async Example (Fluent Tasks)

Forget `TThread` complexity. Use a modern API based on Promises/Tasks:

```pascal
// Asynchronous Task Chaining
var Task := TAsyncTask.Run<TUserProfile>(
  function: TUserProfile
  begin
    // Runs on background
    Result := ExternalApi.GetUserProfile(UserId);
  end)
  .ThenBy<Boolean>(
    function(Profile: TUserProfile): Boolean
    begin
      Result := Profile.IsVerified and Profile.HasCredit;
    end)
  .OnComplete( // Returns to UI Thread automatically
    procedure(IsVerified: Boolean)
    begin
      if IsVerified then
        ShowSuccess('User Verified!')
      else
        ShowError('Verification Failed');
    end)
  .Start; // Starts execution

// Timeout & Cancellation Handling
var CTS := TCancellationTokenSource.Create;

TAsyncTask.Run<TReport>(
  function: TReport
  begin
    // Pass token to long-running operation
    Result := ReportService.GenerateHeavyReport(CTS.Token);
  end)
  .WithCancellation(CTS.Token) // Links token to Task pipeline
  .OnComplete(
    procedure(Report: TReport)
    begin
      ShowReport(Report);
    end)
  .OnException(
    procedure(Ex: Exception)
    begin
      if Ex is EOperationCancelled then
        ShowMessage('Operation timed out!')
      else
        ShowError(Ex.Message);
    end)
  .Start;
```
