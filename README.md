**Dext Framework** is a native and integrated ecosystem for Delphi development.

It brings together Dependency Injection, ORM, Web Pipeline, and Testing into a single, high-performance architecture. Designed to eliminate the need for connecting isolated libraries and to drastically reduce boilerplate code, Dext handles the infrastructure complexity so your team can focus strictly on business logic.

## Where to Use?

Dext was specifically designed to solve the real-world pain points faced by Delphi developers:

* **Web Applications:** Develop complete web applications with Server-Side rendering using WebStencils or native templates integrated into the pipeline.
* **High-Performance APIs:** Build robust RESTful backends using *Minimal APIs*, *Controllers*, or generating direct endpoints with the `[DataApi]` attribute.
* **Concurrency and Asynchrony:** Use *Dext Threading* (Async Task, Cancellation Token, Async Rest Client) to create background routines and non-blocking workflows, replacing the complex manual usage of the `TThread` class.
* **Mobile Backend (iOS/Android):** Provide the integration, connectivity, and security infrastructure needed to support mobile applications efficiently.
* **Legacy Modernization:** Gradually integrate with old 3-tier systems (like DataSnap), ISAPI/Apache middlewares, or Desktop monoliths (VCL) without having to rewrite your 20-year-old ERP. Dext acts as a modern foundation within existing systems.
* **Background Services and Microservices:** Robust data extraction, high-performance scheduled tasks, and connectivity between applications.

## Quick Start

See how Dext's structure simplifies complex flows into clean, typed, and object-oriented code. Exploring the framework's pillars:

### Minimal API

Creating a high-performance endpoint integrated with Dependency Injection requires minimal effort:

```pascal
program MyAPI;

uses Dext.Web;

begin
  var App := WebApplication;
  
  // Simple endpoint
  App.MapGet('/hello', function: string
  begin
    Result := 'Hello from Dext! Modern full-stack for Delphi.';
  end);

  // Endpoint with native Automatic Dependency Injection (DI) and Model Binding
  App.MapPost<TUserDto, IEmailService, IResult>('/register',
    function(Dto: TUserDto; EmailService: IEmailService): IResult
    begin
      EmailService.SendWelcome(Dto.Email);
      Result := Results.Created('/login', 'User successfully registered');
    end);

  App.Run(8080);
end.
```

### Simple Entity (COC, DataApi, and Smart Properties)

Automatic mapping via *Convention over Configuration* and structured properties for advanced relational mapping:

```pascal
[Table]
[DataApi('/api/orders')] // Automatically exposed as a REST API (Zero-Code API)!
TOrder = class
private
  FId: IntType;
  FStatus: Prop<TOrderStatus>;
  FNotes: StringType;
  FTotal: Nullable<CurrencyType>;
  FItems: Lazy<IList<TOrderItem>>;
public
  [PK, AutoInc]
  property Id: IntType read FId write FId;
  property Status: Prop<TOrderStatus> read FStatus write FStatus;
  property Notes: StringType read FNotes write FNotes;
  
  // Smart Types to natively handle nulls, validation, and Lazy Loading
  property Total: Nullable<CurrencyType> read FTotal write FTotal;
  property Items: Lazy<IList<TOrderItem>> read FItems write FItems;
end;
```

### ORM and Strongly Typed Queries (Type-Safe)

No more magic strings or broken queries at runtime. Dext generates the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of your code:

```pascal
// Complex query with Joins and Filters interpreted as clean code
var O := Prototype.Entity<TOrder>;

var Orders := DbContext.Orders
  .Where((O.Status = TOrderStatus.Paid) and (O.Total > 1000))
  .Include('Customer') // Eager Loading
  .Include('Items')
  .OrderBy(O.Date.Desc)
  .Take(50)
  .ToList;

// High-performance Bulk Update directly in the DBMS without loading records into memory
DbContext.Products
  .Where(Prototype.Entity<TProduct>.Category = 'Outdated')
  .Update
  .Execute;
```

### Async Processing (Fluent Tasks)

The complexity of `TThread` transformed into modern asynchronous chained pipelines. The `Fluent Async Tasks` abstraction delivers superpowers over the `PPL` (*Parallel Programming Library*) and `Future<T>`, allowing pipelines based on the *Thread Pool*:

```pascal
var CTS := TCancellationTokenSource.Create;

TAsyncTask.Run<TStream>(
  function: TStream
  begin
    // Requests a free Task from the Thread Pool for network download
    Result := AsyncClient.DownloadStream('https://api.company.com/data', CTS.Token);
  end)
  .Then<TReport>(
    function(Stream: TStream): TReport
    begin
      // Chains a new processing Task as soon as the previous one finishes
      Result := JsonSerializer.Deserialize<TReport>(Stream);
      Stream.Free;
    end)
  .OnComplete(
    procedure(Report: TReport)
    begin
      // Automatically and safely synchronizes the return with the Original Thread (UI)
      ShowReport(Report);
    end)
  .OnException(
    procedure(Ex: Exception)
    begin
      ShowError('Process failed: ' + Ex.Message);
    end)
  .Start;
```

### Configuration, Options & DI

Structured environment for registering services and external configurations using `JSON`, `YAML`, or Environment Variables:

```pascal
  var Builder := WebApplication.CreateBuilder;
  
  // Load hierarchical configuration sources
  Builder.Configuration
    .AddJsonFile('appsettings.json')
    .AddYamlFile('config.yaml')
    .AddEnvironmentVariables;
  
  Builder.Services
    // Natively binds configuration to a strongly-typed class
    .Configure<TDatabaseSettings>(Builder.Configuration.GetSection('Database'))
    
    // Complete Dependency Injection for repositories and services
    .AddSingleton<IEmailService, TSmtpEmailService>
    .AddScoped<IOrderRepository, TDbOrderRepository>;
    
  var App := Builder.Build;
```

### Full VCL Compatibility (TEntityDataSet)

The `TEntityDataSet` converts the ORM's object orientation (POCOs) into *DataSet-compatible* structures consumable by your VCL grids, data-aware components, and Design Time reports, without losing performance!

> Design-Time Support: Native *TFields* creation from entity code and record visualization directly in the IDE.

## Core Features

<p align="center">
  <img src="Docs/Images/dext_ecosystem.png" alt="Dext Ecosystem Architecture" width="80%">
</p>

Dext is composed of flexible and minimalist modules. You retain full control over the architecture and include only the vital components for your solution:

* **Core Technologies:** Enterprise-grade Dependency Injection (Singleton, Transient, Scoped), optimized Reflection cache, advanced event support, and IOptions.
* **Clean Native Collections:** Elimination of memory leaks using interfaces (`IList`, `IDictionary`). Dext solves the classic *Generic Bloat* with Binary Code Folding, significantly reducing huge binaries.
* **Data Access (ORM):** Robust management via *Unit of Work*, automatic transaction control (DAO support), and multi-database support.
* **Web Frameworks:** Embedded HTTP server, *Minimal APIs*, *Controllers*, *DataAPI* REST generator, modular middlewares, *WebSockets* (Hubs), native CORS, *Native HTMX Support*, and extremely fast rendering.
* **AI & Agentic Capabilities:** Built-in **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** Server for seamless integration with AI Assistants (like Claude), exposing your Delphi business logic as AI tools via HTTP Streamable Sessions.
* **Testing & Quality:** Coupled TestContext framework, automated *Mock Objects* (`TAutoMocker`), test coverage, and reporting.

## Design and Philosophy: Born for Performance

Delphi has historically been chosen for domains that did not tolerate overheads; however, recent frameworks have adopted unrestrained allocation patterns based on developer convenience. **Dext returns the performance while maintaining modern ease of use:**

<p align="center">
  <img src="Docs/Images/dext_performance_graph.png" alt="Dext Performance Graph" width="80%">
</p>

1. **Zero-Allocation Pipeline:** When the server exposes JSON or data, common components instantiate and process gigabytes of temporary `string`s, causing deadly spikes in the Memory Manager and forced pauses. Dext bypasses classic conversion through *Direct-to-JSON streaming*, reading entire blocks via immutable memory structures (`TSpan`).
2. **Hardware Affinity (SIMD):** The underlying layers benefit from parallel computing using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) in parsing to ensure response in very few CPU ticks.
