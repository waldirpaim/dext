# Logging and Diagnostics

Dext features a robust logging system, inspired by the .NET ecosystem, which allows you to record structured messages and direct them to different destinations (Sinks).

## Basic Configuration

Logging is configured in the `ConfigureServices` method of your `Startup` class using the fluent builder:

```pascal
procedure TStartup.ConfigureServices(const Services: TDextServices; const Configuration: IConfiguration);
begin
  Services.AddLogging(
    procedure(Builder: ILoggingBuilder)
    begin
      Builder
        .SetMinimumLevel(TLogLevel.Information)
        .AddConsole
        .AddTelemetry; // Routes telemetry events to the log
    end);
end;
```

## Log Levels

The following levels are available (in order of severity):

| Level | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Trace` | Detailed logs for deep diagnostics. |
| `Debug` | Logs useful during development. |
| `Information` | Normal application flows (startup, requests). |
| `Warning` | Anomalous events that do not interrupt the flow. |
| `Error` | Failures that prevent a specific operation. |
| `Critical` | Critical failures requiring immediate attention. |

## File Logging

Dext includes a native provider for recording logs to files. Files are recorded in **JSON Lines** format by default, making them easy to consume by analysis tools.

```pascal
Builder.AddFile('logs/app.log', 10, True); // Name, Max Size (MB), Daily Rotation
```

### File Rotation (Rolling Files)

Dext's file provider supports two automatic rotation mechanisms to prevent log files from growing indefinitely:

1.  **Daily Rotation (`ARollDaily`)**: When enabled, upon a change in date, the current file (e.g., `app.log`) is renamed to include the date (e.g., `app-2026-05-14.log`) and a new log file is started.
2.  **Size Rotation (`AMaxFileSizeMB`)**: If the file reaches the defined limit in Megabytes, it is rotated with a numeric suffix (e.g., `app.001.log`, `app.002.log`) and a new clean file is created.

You can combine both mechanisms to ensure a robust retention policy.

### Thread-Safety and Concurrency

Dext's logging system is **fully thread-safe**.
- The `TFileSink` uses an internal lock (`TMonitor`) to ensure that multiple threads (such as simultaneous HTTP requests) can log without corrupting the file or the buffer.
- Messages are accumulated in a memory buffer (4KB) before being written to disk, drastically reducing I/O operations.

### High Performance with RingBuffer (Async Logging)

For ultra-high performance applications where response time is critical, Dext offers **Async Logging** mode. It utilizes the native lock-free `RingBuffer` so your application thread never blocks waiting for disk or console I/O.

```pascal
Services.AddLogging(
  procedure(Builder: ILoggingBuilder)
  begin
    Builder
      .AddAsync // Enables high-performance mode
      .SetMinimumLevel(TLogLevel.Information)
      .AddConsole
      .AddFile('logs/app.log', 10, True);
  end);
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When enabling `.AddAsync`, Dext automatically manages a buffer pool and a dedicated thread for log dispatching, ensuring that the impact on your application's "Hot Path" is practically zero.

> [!TIP]
> The default synchronous mode is already extremely efficient due to internal 4KB buffering. Async mode is recommended for massive throughput scenarios or where microsecond latencies are important.

## Using ILogger

To record messages, you should request the `ILogger` interface via Dependency Injection in your controllers or services:

```pascal
type
  TMyController = class(TWebController)
  private
    FLogger: ILogger;
  public
    constructor Create(const ALogger: ILogger);
    
    function Get: IWebResponse;
  end;

function TMyController.Get: IWebResponse;
begin
  FLogger.Info('Processing request for {Path}', [Request.Path]);
  // ...
end;
```

### Structured Messages

Dext supports structured messages using the `{}` brace syntax. This allows advanced providers (like the Telemetry Bridge) to capture parameters independently of the formatted message.

```pascal
FLogger.LogInformation('Order {Id} processed successfully in {Duration}ms', [LOrderId, LDuration]);
```

## HTTP Request Logging

To automatically record all HTTP requests (URL, Method, Status Code, Time), add the middleware in the `Configure` method:

```pascal
procedure TStartup.Configure(const App: IWebApplication);
begin
  App.Builder.UseHttpLogging;
  // ...
end;
```
